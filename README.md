## node-red-contrib-custom-chatgpt

A Node-RED node that interacts with OpenAI machine learning models to generate text and image outputs like "ChatGPT" and "DALLÂ·E 2".

### Quick Start

Install with the built in <b>Node-RED Palette manager</b> or using npm:
```
npm install node-red-contrib-custom-chatgpt
```

## Setup

When editing the nodes properties, to get your `OPENAI_API_KEY` log in to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) and then visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys click "+ Create new secret key" then copy and paste the "API key" into the nodes `API_KEY` property value.

To get your `Organization` visit https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings then copy and paste the "OrganizationID" into the nodes `Organization` property value.

## Usage

### Select the node's behavior by setting the Topic property value to `completion`, `image`, `edit`, `turbo` , or `gpt4`.

Once set-up the node can be controlled with as little as a single required message property `msg.payload`.

### Alternatively you can set the Topic to `read from msg.topic` to set the behavior dynamically with incoming messages.

1. When `msg.topic` is set to `completion`:

   - [Required] `msg.payload` should be a well-written prompt that provides enough information for the model to know what you want and how it should respond. Its success generally depends on the complexity of the task and quality of your prompt. A good rule of thumb is to think about how you would write a word problem for a middle schooler to solve.

2. When `msg.topic` is set to `image`:

   - [Required] `msg.payload` should be a prompt of text description of the desired image.

   - [Optional] `msg.size` should be a string of the desired image dimensions. [Default:`256x256`]

   - [Optional] `msg.format` should be a string of either `b64_json` or `url`. [Default:`b64_json`]

3. When `msg.topic` is set to `edit`:

   - [Required] `msg.payload` should be a prompt of text to use as a starting point for the edit.

   - [Required] `msg.last` should be a string of text to use as the input to be edited.

4. When `msg.topic` is set to `turbo`:

   - [Required] `msg.payload` should be a well-written prompt that provides enough information for the model to know what you want and how it should respond. Its success generally depends on the complexity of the task and quality of your prompt.

   - [Optional] `msg.history` should be an array of objects containing the conversation history. [Default:`[]`]

5. When `msg.topic` is set to `gpt4`:

   - [Required] `msg.payload` should be a well-written prompt that provides enough information for the model to know what you want and how it should respond. Its success generally depends on the complexity of the task and quality of your prompt.

   - [Optional] `msg.history` should be an array of objects containing the conversation history. [Default:`[]`]

   - [Optional] `msg.functions` should be an array of objects defining function behaviors for the model. Each object must contain a `name` and `behavior` property. [Default:`[]`]

   - [Optional] `msg.function_call` should be a string or object that controls how the model responds to function calls. "none" means the model does not call a function and responds to the end-user. "auto" allows the model to decide. Specifying a particular function via `{"name":"my_function"}` forces the model to call that function. [Default:`none` if no functions, `auto` if functions are present]

#### Additional optional properties:

The following optional inputs are supported - `msg.max_tokens`, `msg.suffix`, `msg.n`, `msg.temperature`, `msg.top_p`, `msg.presence_penalty`, `msg.frequency_penalty`, and `msg.echo`. See the nodes built in help tab for more information on how they are used.
